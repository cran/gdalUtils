\title{gdal_chooseInstallation}
\usage{
gdal_chooseInstallation(hasDrivers)
}
\arguments{
\item{hasDrivers}{Character. Which drivers must be available?}
}
\value{
Numeric id of the most recent installation that matches the requirements.
}
\description{
Choose a GDAL installation based on certain requirements.
}
\details{
By default, the GDAL commands will use the installation found
at getOption("gdalUtils_gdalPath")[[1]], which is the most recent version
found on the system.  If the user has more than one GDAL installed (more
common on Windows and Mac systems than *nix systems), gdal_chooseInstallation
can be used to choose an installation (perhaps not the most recent one) that
has certain functionality, e.g. supports HDF4 formatted files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Choose the best installation that has both HDF4 and HDF5 drivers:
gdal_chooseInstallation(hasDrivers=c("HDF4","HDF5"))
# Get the version of this installation:
getOption("gdalUtils_gdalPath")[[
	gdal_chooseInstallation(hasDrivers=c("HDF4","HDF5"))]]$version
}
